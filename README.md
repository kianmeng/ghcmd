## :pushpin: About

GHCMD is a simple command line tool for GitHub with a terminal user interface.
It is written in [Golang](https://go.dev/) (a.k.a Go) and uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github) library to access the API.
For the terminal user interface it uses [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework with [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) components.
For now, it is a work in progress and only supports a few commands.
